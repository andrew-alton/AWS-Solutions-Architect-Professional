# Interface Endpoints


## Basic Architecture
An interface endpoint is an ENI with a private IP address from the IP address 
range of your subnet.

The ENI serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported AWS service 
or a VPC endpoint service.

## Security Group Integration
Since the Interface Endpoints uses ENI, you can associate a security group to it.
This allows customers to restrict access to endpoint based on their 
requirements.

## On-Premise Support

Since Interface Endpoints creates an Elastic Network Interface inside the VPC, 
the on-premise systems can connect to it via VPN and Direct Connect.
